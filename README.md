# Computer-Depreciation-Calculator

Problem the code Solve
The code helps the manager to knonw:
		- Type of computer (Desktop/laptop)
		- its Residual value
		- location where it can be found inside the company (e.g building G room 5)
		- And finally the computer's annual depreciation

Problem solving approach
	- I created three objects ComputerObject super class and 
	laptop and Desktop as subclasses to inherite attributes and/or method from the super class.
	- And I implimented the abstract method Annual depreciation from the super class in both the subclasses.
